# animated-extended-attributes

![alt tag](http://vipyne.github.io/100-days/11/screenshots/rainbow-metadata-NINE.gif)

this whimsical Bash script will change the color tag extended attribute 
on a file quickly and in effect 'animate' in the Mac OS Finder application. 
(only tested in 10.11 so far).
